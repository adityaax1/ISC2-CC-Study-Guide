# 🔐 Security Operations

> 🖥️ **Application Server**  
> A computer responsible for hosting applications to user workstations.  
> *NIST SP 800-82 Rev.2*

> 🔑 **Asymmetric Encryption**  
> An algorithm that uses one key to encrypt and a different key to decrypt plaintext.

> ✔️ **Checksum**  
> A digit representing the sum of the correct digits in stored or transmitted digital data, used to detect errors later.

> 🔒 **Ciphertext**  
> The altered form of plaintext, unreadable except to intended recipients—a secret message form.

> 🛡️ **Classification**  
> Identifies the degree of harm if information is exposed to unauthorized parties, focusing on data confidentiality based on sensitivity.

> ⚙️ **Configuration Management**  
> Ensures only authorized and validated changes are made to systems.

> 🕵️‍♂️ **Cryptanalyst**  
> One who studies and attempts to break cryptographic techniques and security systems.

> 🔐 **Cryptography**  
> The study and methods used to secure messages or files by disguise, obscuration, or other transformations.

> 🛑 **Data Loss Prevention (DLP)**  
> Systems designed to detect and prevent unauthorized use and transmission of information.

> 🔓 **Decryption**  
> The process of converting ciphertext back to plaintext using the correct key (same for symmetric, different for asymmetric encryption). Also called deciphering.

> 🧲 **Degaussing**  
> Erasing data on magnetic media (disks, tapes) by removing magnetic remanence so data cannot be recovered.

> ✍️ **Digital Signature**  
> A cryptographic transformation providing origin authentication, data integrity, and non-repudiation.  
> *NIST SP 800-12 Rev. 1*

> 📤 **Egress Monitoring**  
> Monitoring of outgoing network traffic.

> 🔐 **Encryption**  
> The act of converting plaintext into ciphertext (also called enciphering).

> 🧩 **Encryption System**  
> The combined algorithms, processes, hardware, software, and procedures that enable encryption and decryption.

> 🛡️ **Hardening**  
> Applying secure configurations and locking down hardware, systems, and software to reduce attack surfaces, often based on CIS benchmarks.

> 🔢 **Hash Function**  
> An algorithm that computes a unique numerical value (hash) representing a file or message, like a fingerprint.  
> *NIST SP 800-152*

> 🔄 **Hashing**  
> Using an algorithm to produce a numeric value representing data.  
> *CNSSI 4009-2015*

> 📥 **Ingress Monitoring**  
> Monitoring of incoming network traffic.

> 🧾 **Message Digest**  
> A digital signature uniquely identifying data; changing a single bit alters the digest completely.  
> *NISTIR-8011 Vol.3*

> 💻 **Operating System**  
> The master control software loaded first when a computer starts, managing hardware and applications.  
> *NIST SP 800-44 Version 2*

> 🩹 **Patch**  
> A software component that modifies other software files or settings without changing version numbers.  
> *ISO/IEC 19770-2*

> 🔄 **Patch Management**  
> Systematic process of notifying, identifying, deploying, and verifying patches, hot fixes, and service packs.  
> *CNSSI4009*

> 📄 **Plaintext**  
> Data/message in readable form, highly vulnerable to exposure.

> 📝 **Records**  
> Automated/manual evidence of activities or results verifying system performance. Includes groups of related data fields.  
> *NIST SP 800-53 Rev.4*

> 🗃️ **Records Retention**  
> Practice of keeping records for necessary duration and destroying them after a specified interval.

> ♻️ **Remanence**  
> Residual data remaining on storage media after clearing.  
> *NIST SP 800-88 Rev. 1*

> 📝 **Request for Change (RFC)**  
> First stage of change management where a change is formally requested by a stakeholder.

> 🏛️ **Security Governance**  
> Policies, roles, and processes an organization uses to make security decisions.

> 🎭 **Social Engineering**  
> Tactics like email, phone, text, or social media impersonations to infiltrate systems. Low-tech methods include tailgating.

> 🔐 **Symmetric Encryption**  
> An algorithm using the same key for both encryption and decryption.

> 🌐 **Web Server**  
> Computer providing WWW services including hardware, OS, server software, and content. If internal-only, called an intranet server.  
> *NIST SP 800-44 Version 2*

> 🐋 **Whaling Attack**  
> Phishing targeting high-level officials or wealthy individuals to trick them into authorizing large fund transfers.
