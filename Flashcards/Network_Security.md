# 🌐 Network Security

> 🔗 **Application programming interface (API)**  
> A set of routines, standards, protocols, and tools for building software applications to access a web-based software application or web tool.

> 🔢 **Bit**  
> The most essential representation of data (zero or one) at Layer 1 of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.

> 📡 **Broadcast**  
> Broadcast transmission is a one-to-many (one-to-everyone) form of sending internet traffic.

> 💾 **Byte**  
> A unit of digital information that most commonly consists of eight bits.

> ☁️ **Cloud computing**  
> A model for enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources (networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) that can be rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort or service provider interaction.  
> *NIST 800-145*

> 🏘️ **Community cloud**  
> Cloud infrastructure provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations with shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, compliance). Owned/managed by one or more organizations or third parties, may exist on or off premises.  
> *NIST 800-145*

> 📦 **De-encapsulation**  
> The opposite of encapsulation; bundles of data are unpacked or revealed.

> ⛔ **Denial-of-Service (DoS)**  
> The prevention of authorized access to resources or delaying of time-critical operations (milliseconds to hours).  
> *NIST SP 800-27 Rev A*

> 🌐 **Domain Name Service (DNS)**  
> Refers to a service, a physical server, and a network protocol for resolving domain names to IP addresses.

> 📦 **Encapsulation**  
> Bundling data and methods, hiding data/code during software development and operational use. Also packaging data inside other data structures (e.g., in network protocols, encryption).

> 🔑 **Encryption**  
> The process of converting plaintext to ciphertext to protect information, also called enciphering.

> 📁 **File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**  
> Internet protocol and program used to transfer files between hosts.

> 🧩 **Fragment attack**  
> Attack where traffic is fragmented to prevent a system from correctly reassembling packets.

> 🖥️ **Hardware**  
> The physical parts of a computer and related devices.

> 🌥️ **Hybrid cloud**  
> A mix of public and private cloud storage, with critical data kept in the private cloud and other data in the public cloud.

> 🏗️ **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)**  
> Provides core computing, storage, and network hardware/software foundation for building and deploying applications. Typically billed on usage.

> 📶 **Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP)**  
> An IP network protocol to check if a service or host is available.  
> *RFC 792*

> 🌍 **Internet Protocol (IPv4)**  
> Standard protocol for data transmission between source and destination in packet-switched networks.  
> *CNSSI4009-2015*

> 🕵️ **Man-in-the-Middle**  
> Attack where adversary intercepts and possibly alters data between a user and a system.  
> *NISTIR 7711*

> 🛡️ **Microsegmentation**  
> Zero-trust strategy that breaks LANs into small zones using firewalls or similar, potentially placing firewalls at every connection point.

> ⚠️ **Oversized Packet Attack**  
> Sending packets larger than expected or handled by the receiver, causing failure.

> 📦 **Packet**  
> Representation of data at Layer 3 of the OSI model.

> 💣 **Payload**  
> The primary action or malicious code part of an attack.

> 💳 **Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)**  
> Information security standard for merchants and service providers processing credit/debit card transactions.

> 🛠️ **Platform as a Service (PaaS)**  
> Middleware environment for building applications in the cloud before deployment as SaaS.

> 🏢 **Private cloud**  
> Cloud computing platform implemented within the corporate firewall under IT control, offering benefits of cloud systems but with control over data and compliance.

> 📜 **Protocols**  
> Rules (formats and procedures) controlling communication between systems.  
> *NIST SP 800-82 Rev.2*

> 🌐 **Public cloud**  
> Cloud infrastructure open for general public use, owned/managed by various organizations, existing on cloud provider premises.  
> *NIST SP 800-145*

> ✉️ **Simple Mail Transport Protocol (SMTP)**  
> Standard protocol for sending and receiving emails.

> 💽 **Software**  
> Computer programs and associated data, which can be dynamically written or modified during execution.  
> *NIST SP 80-37 Rev. 2*

> ☁️ **Software as a Service (SaaS)**  
> Cloud provider’s applications accessible via thin client interfaces like web browsers. Consumers do not manage underlying infrastructure.  
> *Derived from NIST 800-145*

> 🎭 **Spoofing**  
> Faking the sending address of a transmission to gain illegal entry.  
> *CNSSI 4009-2015*

> 🕸️ **Transport Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Model**  
> IETF protocol model specifying four layers: Link, Internet, Transport, and Application layers.

> 🖧 **Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN)**  
> Logical grouping of devices appearing as the same LAN despite geographic distribution.

> 🔒 **VPN (Virtual Private Network)**  
> A secure communication mechanism built on top of existing networks.

> 📡 **Wireless Area Network (WLAN)**  
> Group of computers/devices connected via radio transmissions (Wi-Fi is a type of WLAN).

> 🔍 **Zenmap**  
> GUI for Nmap Security Scanner, used to scan networks and discover connected devices.

> 🚫 **Zero Trust**  
> Security model removing assumptions of trusted network spaces, managing security at each level, often using microsegmentation.
